# odin-admin-dashboard

The goal of this project is to create an admin dashboard website using the CSS grid and (optionally) flexbox for layout. I have decided to incorporate both grid and flexbox in this exercise.

The final project includes the links base for the previous odin projects.

One of the aims was to learn how to create proper HTML structure with the appropriate distinction between given elements, parents and children.
